c encrypted w/ client's public key
s encrypted w/ server's public key
m encrypted w/ master key
o encrypted w/ session derived key

== Terms Principles ==
Nodes consist of one or more Hosts.
Each Host has one or more Clients connected.
A client can connect to a host and proxy to another host. This is how nodes are expanded and joined.
A typical scenario might involve a host running locally connected as a client of another node. Local clients can then connect to the local host and conserve bandwidth.

The only finite resources are time and bandwidth.
Data can be immutable but never unique. Embrace duplication.

== Message Base ==
- Literal message type string
? Payload
- Signature of message type and payload

== Connection ==
Client sends 
	- CONNECT REQ
	- client's public key 
	- connection nonce
	- signature
[Optional server authentication]
[Server associates public key and session master key with session ID]
Server sends
	- CONNECT REP
	- server's public key
	c session ID
	c session master key
	c session nonce
	- connection nonce + 1
	- signature
[Client is now connected]

== Message Passing ==
Client sends
	- MESSAGE REQ
	o session ID
	o payload
	o session nonce + 1
	- signature
[Server retrieves public key, master key, and session nonce by session ID]
[Server verifies message (signature and nonce)]
[Server acts on payload]
Server sends
	- MESSAGE REP
	o session ID
	o result
	o session nonce + 1
	- signature
